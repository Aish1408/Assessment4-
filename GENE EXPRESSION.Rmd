# Define the URL for the gene expression data
URL<- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghazkha/Assessment4/main/gene_expression.tsv"
# Read the gene expression data
pip=read.table(URL,stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header= TRUE,row.names = 1)

# Check the structure of the data
str(pip)
# Display the values for the first six genes
head(pip, 6)
```
Objective of the above code is to import the gene expression data into R for analysis, where, read.table function is used to read TSV file, specifying that the first row contains headers and first column contains gene identifiers. This results in data frame where each row represents a gene and each column represents a sample.
OUTCOME: A well structured data frame ready for future analysis.



```{r}
# Calculate the mean of each columns (genes) and add it as a new column
pip=colMeans(t(pip))
# Display the first six rows including the new column
head(pip, 6)
```
Objective behind this code is to calculate average expression level of each gene across all samples. rowMean funstion is used in order to compute the mean for each row (gene). this mean value as a new column is called Mean_expression in the data frame. 
An updated data frame with an additional column representing the mean expression for all gene is the outcome of this code.

```{r}
# Ensure pip is a data frame
pip <- as.data.frame(pip)
# Calculate the mean of each row (genes) and add it as a new column
pip$Mean_Expression <- rowMeans(pip)
ordered_pip <- pip[order(-pip$Mean_Expression), ]
# Select and display the top 10 genes
top_10_genes <- head(ordered_pip, 10)
print(top_10_genes)
```
The script processes a gene expression dataset to identify the top 10 genes with the highest average expression levels. It first ensures the dataset is a data frame, calculates the mean expression for each gene across all samples, and then sorts the genes based on their mean expression in descending order. Finally, it selects and displays the top 10 genes with the highest mean expression. The purpose is to prioritize genes with the most significant expression, which could be of interest for further analysis.

```{r}
# Ensure pip is a data frame
pip <- as.data.frame(pip)
# Calculate the mean of each row (genes) and add it as a new column
pip$Mean_Expression <- rowMeans(pip)
# Determine the number of genes with a mean expression less than 10
num_genes_low_mean <- sum(pip$Mean_Expression < 10)
# Display the result
print(num_genes_low_mean)
```
The above code determines how many genes have mean expression value below threshold of 10, where, sum function is used to count number of genes in Mean_Expression less than 10. The count of genes with mean expression values below 10, providing insights into expression landscape.

```{r}
# Create a histogram of the Mean_Expression values
hist(pip$Mean_Expression,
     # Title of the histogram
     main = "Histogram of Mean Expression Values",
     # Label for the x-axis
     xlab = "Mean Expression",
     # Label for the y-axis
     ylab = "Frequency",
     # Color of the bars
     col = "lightblue",
     # Color of the bars
     border = "black")
```
The Objective here is to visualize the distribution of mean expression values across all genes. Using hist function creates a histogram of the Mean_Expression values. A histogram that visually represents the distribution of gene expression means, highlighting patterns such as central tendency and variability.

```{r}
# Install the readr package 
install.packages("readr")
```

```{r}
# Load the readr package
library(readr)
# Define the URL for the growth data
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ghazkha/Assessment4/refs/heads/main/growth_data.csv"

# Read the growth data
growth_data <- read_csv(url)
# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(growth_data)
```


```{r}
# Display the column names of the growth_data dataset
colnames(growth_data)
```
The  R code begins by installing the `readr` package and loading it to facilitate data import. It then defines a URL where the growth data CSV file is located and uses the `read_csv` function to read the data into an R object called `growth_data`. The `head()` function is utilized to display the first few rows of the dataset, providing a quick preview of the data structure. Finally, the `colnames()` function is called to extract and display the column names of the `growth_data` object, allowing users to understand the variables included in the dataset.
The dataset comprises six columns: "Site," "TreeID," and four circumference measurements (in cm) for the years 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2020, with a total of 100 rows. The "Site" column categorizes trees into "northeast" and "southwest" regions, while "TreeID" uniquely identifies each tree. The numerical columns document the circumference growth over time. Sample rows illustrate how each tree's growth is tracked across the specified years.
```{r}
# Load the necessary packages
library(readr)
# Calculate mean and standard deviation using the $ operator
mean_start <- mean(growth_data$Circumf_2005_cm, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_start <- sd(growth_data$Circumf_2005_cm, na.rm = TRUE)

mean_end <- mean(growth_data$Circumf_2020_cm, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_end <- sd(growth_data$Circumf_2020_cm, na.rm = TRUE)

# Check for NA values in the calculated statistics
if (is.na(mean_start) || is.na(sd_start) || is.na(mean_end) || is.na(sd_end)) {
  stop("One or more statistics could not be calculated due to NA values.")
}

# Create a data frame to store the statistics
circumference_stats <- data.frame(
  mean_start = mean_start,
  sd_start = sd_start,
  mean_end = mean_end,
  sd_end = sd_end
)

# Print the statistics
print(circumference_stats)
```
The  R code imports a CSV file into an R object called `growth_data` and calculates the mean and standard deviation of tree circumference for the years 2005 and 2020. It utilizes the `$` operator to access the relevant columns while excluding any missing values. The code checks for NA values in the calculated statistics and halts execution if any statistic cannot be computed. A data frame is then created to store the calculated mean and standard deviation values, which are subsequently printed. To display the column names of the `growth_data` object, the `colnames(growth_data)` function can be used.
The mean tree circumference at the start of the study (2005) was approximately 5.08 cm, with a standard deviation of 1.05 cm, indicating that the trees were relatively small and consistent in size at the beginning. By the end of the study (2020), the mean circumference increased significantly to about 49.91 cm, with a standard deviation of 22.18 cm, suggesting substantial growth over the 15-year period. The increase in standard deviation also indicates greater variability in tree growth rates, reflecting differences in individual tree responses to environmental conditions or management practices.

```{r}
# Load the necessary packages
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)

# Reshape the data using base R
growth_data_long <- data.frame(
  Site = rep(growth_data$Site, each = 2),
  Time = rep(c("Start (2005)", "End (2020)"), times = nrow(growth_data)),
  Circumference = c(growth_data$Circumf_2005_cm, growth_data$Circumf_2020_cm)
)

# Create the box plot
ggplot(growth_data_long, aes(x = Time, y = Circumference, fill = Site)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Tree Circumference at Start and End of Study",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Circumference (cm)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
```

The R code created a box plot to visualize tree circumference at the start (2005) and end (2020) of the study for both sites. It reshaped the `growth_data` dataset into a long format using the `data.frame()` function, which included columns for `Site`, `Time`, and `Circumference`. The `ggplot2` package was then utilized to generate the box plot, mapping `Time` to the x-axis and `Circumference` to the y-axis, with fill colors representing different sites. Customizations included a title, axis labels, and a minimal theme for clarity. The resulting box plot effectively illustrated differences in tree growth over the study period between the two sites.

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(readr)
# Calculate growth from 2005 to 2020 and add it as a new column
growth_data$Growth <- growth_data$Circumf_2020_cm - growth_data$Circumf_2005_cm
# Calculate mean growth by site
mean_growth <- aggregate(Growth ~ Site, data = growth_data, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
# Print the mean growth by site
print(mean_growth)
```

The R code calculates the mean growth of trees over the last 10 years for each site. It begins by loading the `readr` library, which is necessary for reading data. The code then computes the growth from 2005 to 2020 by subtracting the circumference measured in 2005 from that measured in 2020, storing the result in a new column called `Growth` within the `growth_data` object. Next, the code uses the `aggregate()` function to calculate the mean growth, grouped by site, while ignoring any missing values with `na.rm = TRUE`. Finally, the calculated mean growth values for each site are printed to the console, providing insights into the growth performance of trees at different locations.
The northeast site had a mean growth of approximately 48.94 cm, while the southwest site had a lower mean growth of around 40.73 cm. This suggests that trees in the northeast experienced better growth compared to those in the southwest, potentially due to differences in environmental factors, soil quality, or management practices at the two sites.

```{r}
# Load necessary library
library(readr)
# Perform a t-test to compare growth between the two sites
t_test_result <- t.test(Growth ~ Site, data = growth_data)
# Display the t-test results
print(t_test_result)
# Extract and display the p-value
p_value <- t_test_result$p.value
cat("The p-value for the difference in growth between the two sites is:", p_value, "\n")
```
To estimate the p-value for the difference in 10-year growth between the two sites, a t-test was conducted using the "t.test()" function in R. The test compared the "Growth" variable between the two groups defined by the "Site" column in the dataset. The result of the t-test was printed, and the p-value was extracted and displayed using the "cat()" function to indicate whether there was a statistically significant difference in growth between the sites over the 10-year period.
The Welch Two Sample t-test comparing the 10-year mean growth between the "northeast" and "southwest" sites yielded a t-statistic of 1.9121 and a p-value of 0.05912, which is slightly above the 0.05 significance threshold. This indicates that the difference in mean growth is not statistically significant at the 5% level, though it is close. The 95% confidence interval (-0.3226 to 16.7266) includes zero, supporting the conclusion that there is no strong evidence of a difference. Despite the "northeast" site showing higher mean growth, the result suggests this difference could be due to random variation.

This project investigates the coding DNA sequences (CDS) of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Anaerococcus tetradius, two microorganisms with distinct ecological niches and metabolic pathways. E. coli, a well-researched bacterium found in the intestines of warm-blooded organisms, is notable for its versatility and rapid growth, making it an ideal model for studies on gene regulation and microbial interactions. In contrast, A. tetradius, associated with anaerobic environments, has fewer coding sequences and unique metabolic adaptations, offering insights into evolutionary strategies and niche specialization. 

The analysis began with downloading and counting the coding DNA sequences (CDS) for both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Anaerococcus tetradius. The following code was employed to download the CDS for E. coli from the Ensembl database, decompress the file, and subsequently read the sequences: 

```{r}

anaerococcus_cds_count <- length(anaerococcus_cds) 
ecoli_cds <- seqinr::read.fasta("ecoli_cds.fa") 
ecoli_cds_count <- length(ecoli_cds) 
 # Create a data frame to summarize CDS counts 
cds_table <- data.frame( 
Organism = c("Anaerococcus tetradius", "E. coli"), 
CDS_Count = c(anaerococcus_cds_count, ecoli_cds_count) 
) 
 # Print the table summarizing the CDS counts 
print(cds_table) 
``` 
Coding DNA Sequence Download and Count

Examining the biological sequence diversity started with downloading the entire set of coding DNA sequences (CDS) for E. coli and Anaerococcus tetradius from the Ensembl database. The download URLs for both organisms were provided, and the download.file() function was used to retrieve the files, followed by gunzip() to decompress them. The sequences were then read into R using the seqinr::read.fasta() function.
 
After reading the CDS files, calculated the number of coding sequences present in each organism.
 
As seen, E. coli has significantly more coding sequences (4239) than Anaerococcus tetradius (1836). This difference could be attributed to the organism's genome size, functional complexity, or evolutionary factors.
 
The analysis continued by calculating the total coding DNA content for both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Anaerococcus tetradius. The lengths of individual coding sequences were summarized and summed to obtain the total coding DNA content for each organism. The following code was utilized for this purpose:
```{r}
len_anaerococcus <- as.numeric(summary(anaerococcus_cds)[, 1])
total_coding_dna_anaerococcus <- sum(len_anaerococcus)
len_ecoli <- as.numeric(summary(ecoli_cds)[, 1])
 
total_coding_dna_ecoli <- sum(len_ecoli)
 
coding_dna_table <- data.frame(
 
Organism = c("Anaerococcus tetradius", "E. coli"),
 
Total_Coding_DNA = c(total_coding_dna_anaerococcus, total_coding_dna_ecoli)
)
print(coding_dna_table)
```
Total Coding DNA Content    
Calculated the total length of coding DNA for both organisms by summing the lengths of all coding sequences.
The total coding DNA content of E. coli is more than double that of Anaerococcus tetradius, corresponding to the higher number of coding sequences in E. coli. This difference reflects the greater functional and metabolic diversity in E. coli, which requires more genes to perform various cellular processes.

The analysis proceeded to assess the distribution of coding sequence lengths for both Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Anaerococcus tetradius. The lengths of individual coding sequences were calculated, and their distributions were visualized using boxplots to illustrate the variation in coding sequence lengths. The following R code was implemented to perform this analysis:
 
```{r}
cds_anaerococcus <- seqinr::read.fasta("anaerococcus_cds.fa")
 
cds_ecoli <- seqinr::read.fasta("ecoli_cds.fa")
 
len_anaerococcus <- as.numeric(summary(cds_anaerococcus)[, 1])
 
sum(len_anaerococcus)
 
boxplot(len_anaerococcus, ylab="Sequence length (bp)", main="Anaerococcus CDS Length")
 
mean(len_anaerococcus)
 
median(len_anaerococcus)
 
len_ecoli <- as.numeric(summary(cds_ecoli)[, 1])
 
sum(len_ecoli)
 
boxplot(len_ecoli, ylab="Sequence length (bp)", main="E. coli CDS Length")
 
mean(len_ecoli)
 
median(len_ecoli)
```
CDS Length Distribution   
Calculated the lengths of individual coding sequences for both organisms and plotted their distribution using boxplots. The boxplots provide a visual representation of the variation in coding sequence lengths.
 
From the boxplot and summary statistics, observations were made that Anaerococcus tetradius has a slightly higher mean CDS length (957 bp) compared to E. coli (938 bp). However, the median length for E. coli is higher (831 bp) than for Anaerococcus tetradius (804 bp). The distribution of coding sequence lengths is fairly similar between the two organisms, but with slight differences in their means and medians, indicating that Anaerococcus tetradius has more longer CDS on average.
 
 
The analysis focused on the nucleotide and protein compositions of the coding sequences (CDS) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Anaerococcus tetradius. These two organisms serve as valuable models for studying genomic characteristics due to their differing ecological niches and metabolic pathways. Understanding their genetic composition is essential for insights into microbial diversity, evolutionary adaptations, and potential biotechnological applications. The investigation began with calculating the nucleotide frequencies of adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C), followed by translating the CDS into protein sequences to assess the frequency of amino acids. This comprehensive analysis aims to reveal how the distinct genomic features of these organisms relate to their biological functions and ecological roles.

anaerococcus_seq <- paste(anaerococcus_cds, collapse = "")
 
# Step 3: Calculate the frequency of nucleotides in the CDS for both organisms
dna_freq_ecoli <- table(strsplit(ecoli_seq, NULL)[[1]])
dna_freq_anaerococcus <- table(strsplit(anaerococcus_seq, NULL)[[1]])
 
# Step 4: Create bar plots for the nucleotide composition
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))  # Set up the plotting area to have two plots side by side
barplot(dna_freq_ecoli, xlab = "Nucleotides", ylab = "Frequency", 
        main = "E. coli CDS Composition", col = "blue")
barplot(dna_freq_anaerococcus, xlab = "Nucleotides", ylab = "Frequency", 
        main = "Anaerococcus CDS Composition", col = "red")
 
# Step 5: Translate the CDS sequences to protein sequences

anaerococcus_protein <- sapply(anaerococcus_cds, function(seq) translate(s2c(seq)))
 
# Step 6: Calculate the frequency of amino acids in the protein sequences
protein_freq_ecoli <- table(unlist(ecoli_protein))
protein_freq_anaerococcus <- table(unlist(anaerococcus_protein))
 
# Step 7: Create bar plots for the protein composition

barplot(protein_freq_anaerococcus, xlab = "Amino Acids", ylab = "Frequency", 
        main = "Anaerococcus Protein Composition", col = "red")
 
```
The analysis examined the nucleotide composition of the coding sequences (CDS) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Anaerococcus tetradius, focusing on the frequency of the DNA bases adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Results indicated a relatively balanced nucleotide composition, with a slight bias toward A and G in E. coli, while A. tetradius exhibited a more uniform distribution. These differences suggest genomic adaptations to their environments, reflecting E. coli's metabolic flexibility.
 
Additionally, the coding sequences were translated into protein sequences, revealing varying amino acid frequencies. E. coli displayed higher prevalence of certain amino acids linked to its metabolic pathways, while A. tetradius had a distinct amino acid profile. This variation is likely influenced by the ecological niches of both organisms, affecting their codon usage and protein composition.
 
The analysis aimed to create a codon usage table and quantify the codon usage bias among the coding sequences (CDS) of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Anaerococcus tetradius. This involved examining the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) for both organisms, identifying any significant differences in their codon usage patterns, and investigating the k-mer frequencies within the protein sequences of the organism of interest compared to E. coli.

        legend.text = c("E. coli", "Anaerococcus tetradius"),
        args.legend = list(x = "topright", bty = "n"))
```
Codon Usage Table and Bias Quantification
The codon usage analysis was performed using the R programming language, leveraging the seqinr library to handle FASTA files containing the CDS for both organisms. The sequences were concatenated into single strings for each organism, which were subsequently analyzed to create RSCU tables. The RSCU values were computed to determine the relative frequency of codon usage, highlighting any biases present in the coding sequences.
The results of the RSCU analysis were visualized using bar plots, which revealed distinct patterns in codon usage between the two organisms:
E. coli: The RSCU values indicated a bias toward certain codons, particularly those associated with its metabolic pathways. The analysis showed a tendency for the usage of codons that correspond to amino acids prevalent in E. coli's metabolic processes.
Anaerococcus tetradius: The RSCU values displayed a more uniform distribution across codons, suggesting less pronounced codon usage bias. This may reflect its adaptation to a different ecological niche and metabolic requirements.
 
K-mer Frequency Analysis
To further investigate the protein sequences of the organism of interest, the analysis computed k-mer frequencies for k-mer lengths of 3, 4, and 5. This involved the calculation of k-mer frequencies using the following function:
K-mers were generated for both the organism of interest and E. coli, and the resulting frequencies were compiled into a comparison data frame. This analysis allowed for the identification of over- and under-represented k-mers, which were ranked based on their frequency ratios between the two organisms.
The top 10 over-represented and under-represented k-mers were extracted and visualized using bar plots generated with the ggplot2 library

The k-mer analysis revealed distinct differences in the presence of specific sequences within the genomes of the two organisms:
Over-represented k-mers: These sequences were found at higher levels in the organism of interest compared to E. coli. Their prevalence could indicate particular biological functions or adaptations unique to the organism's ecological niche.
Under-represented k-mers: These sequences were present at lower levels in the organism of interest, suggesting that they may be less favorable or relevant in the context of its biology compared to E. coli.
This differential k-mer representation may stem from variations in codon preference and protein synthesis efficiency influenced by factors such as environmental adaptation, metabolic requirements, and evolutionary pressures.
 
Conclusion
The analysis of coding DNA sequences (CDS) in *Escherichia coli* and *Anaerococcus tetradius* highlights significant genomic and metabolic diversity between the two organisms. *E. coli* exhibits a higher number of CDS, greater total coding DNA, and specific nucleotide biases, reflecting its metabolic flexibility and ecological adaptability. In contrast, *A. tetradius* shows fewer CDS and a more uniform nucleotide composition, indicating niche specialization. Codon usage and k-mer frequency analyses further reveal distinct adaptations, with *E. coli* favoring certain codons and k-mers associated with its metabolic pathways. Overall, the genomic differences underscore the ecological and evolutionary strategies adopted by each organism.
